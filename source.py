# ## Topic
# 
# The problem we are addressing is total energy consumption vs energy output

# ## Project Question
# *What specific question are you seeking to answer with this project?*
# *This is not the same as the questions you ask to limit the scope of the project.*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->
# On our trajectory (the world) how long can we really last with how we manage our energy. Is it really sustainable? Are there better decisions to be made regarding how to acquire green energy and reuse it.

# ## What would an answer look like?
# *What is your hypothesized answer to your question?*
# üìù There are many more sustainable ways to harvest energy. We will eliminate fossil fuels and operate on full green energy such as wind and solar.

# ## Data Sources
# *What 3 data sources have you identified for this project?*

#  Based on these trends, it seems like the United States is doing much better than India and China in terms of controlling CO2 emissions. It is still extremely high, but it has a down trend rather then an up trend like China and India

#  So far, what I have completed is, 
#  Calculated statistical summaries for numerical columns like CO2 emissions using Pandas' describe() method.
#  Obtained value counts or frequency distribution for categorical columns using Pandas' value_counts() method.
#  Created histograms or boxplots to visualize distributions of numerical columns like CO2 emissions, energy consumption, etc., using Matplotlib or Seaborn.
#  Generated bar charts or count plots for categorical data to display the distribution of categories using Matplotlib or Seaborn.
#  Calculated and visualized a correlation matrix to understand relationships between numerical features using Pandas and Seaborn.
#  dentified and handled missing values using Pandas' isnull() or dropna() method to decide whether to impute or remove them.
#  Checked and transformed data types of columns using Pandas' dtypes attribute and astype() method for conversions if needed.
# 

#  These examples cover various aspects of EDA by performing operations such as summary statistics, distribution visualizations, correlation analysis, handling missing values, outliers, and data type transformations.

#  Types of machine learning I can possibly use.
#  Regression Models: Predicting quantitative values such as energy consumption, CO2 emissions, or renewable energy production using linear regression, polynomial regression, or other regression techniques.
# 

# Issues and Challenges
# Issues related to missing data, outliers, or inconsistencies might impact model performance. 
# Different scales or distributions of features might affect the performance of some algorithms.
# Guarding against overfitting by using proper cross-validation techniques and selecting appropriate evaluation metrics to measure model performance accurately.
# 

# We begin Machine learning
# Will start by preprocessing the data, like checking for missing values.
